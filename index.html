				The sum of these points was then calculated for all potential links in the sample - the IPUMS preserves these sums in MOMLNKWT (Weight of mother link) and <a href="#usa1">WIFLNKWT</a> (Weight of wife link). If the sum exceeded a prespecified minimum, the link was accepted, and if it fell below a prespecified minimum, the link was rejected. When the sum of weights fell in the gray zone links were carried out by hand, by reexamining the case on the original microfilm. The final rationale for each link is recorded in the <a href="#usa2">MOMLKREA</a> and <a href="#usa3">WIFLKREA</a> variables.
